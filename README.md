## About this project 
In creating this weather app, an HTML structure was established to frame the content, while CSS styling enhanced its visual appeal. The JavaScript script.js file encapsulates the weather-related functionalities, using the Fetch API to asynchronously retrieve real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Error handling was implemented for a seamless user experience, and dynamic updates to the DOM were made to display key weather information. The app features a responsive design, and the background image changes dynamically based on the searched city, using the Unsplash API. With a user-friendly interface and the integration of third-party resources like Google Fonts, the app provides an engaging and educational experience, offering up-to-date weather details for different cities. The combination of functionality, aesthetics, and real-time data contributes to the app's appeal and potential business impact.
